        <p>Welcome to my Closet! I'm currently trying to empty out my closet but I would hate it to see these clothings go to waste. 
            So this is me trying to sell my clothes. Please contact me and let me know what you are interested in! Prices are negotiable. I
            will be adding new clothes weekly, so stay tune!
